  <h1>Chicago</h1>
  <h3>Song Lyrics</h3>

  <hr>

  <p>
    Ah, I met her on my way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" target="_blank">Chicago</a> <br> Where she was all <strong>alone</strong> <br>
    And so was I, so I asked her for her name<br>
    She smiled and looked at me<br>
    I was surprised to see<br>
    That a woman like that was really into me
  </p>

  <h4>What she claimed:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>She said she didn't have no man</li>
    <li>Raised the kids the very best she can <em>(She was lovin' me)</em></li> <li>She told me she was all alone</li>
    <li>Said at home, she didn't have no phone <em>(She was wantin' me)</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>The breakdown:</h4>

  <ol>
    <li>She said just to give her a page</li>
    <li>Fifty-nine&nbsp;was the code she gave</li> <li>She'd lied to you, lied to me</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    'Cause she was <b>lovin' me</b>, lovin' me, yeah.
  </p>

  <p>
    I never woulda thought she was livin' like that<br>
    Her words seemed so sincere<br>
    When I held her near, she would tell me how she feels<br>
    It felt so real to me, this girl, she had to be<br>
    An angel sent from Heaven just for me.
  </p>
